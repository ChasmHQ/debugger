"""The MCP tool surface.

Every tool is a thin async wrapper that runs a driver method off the event loop
(the session blocks by design) and returns a dict: models get structured JSON,
and every windowed result says whether it was truncated so the next call can
narrow itself. Errors return as `{"error": ...}` dicts rather than protocol
errors, so the model can read and recover from them.

INSTRUCTIONS = """sevm: a gdb-style Solidity/EVM debugger running on REVM.

Workflow: sevm_start_session (a web3.py driver script or a .t.sol Foundry test)
loads and compiles the target and stops at the first contract instruction.
Then navigate (sevm_continue / sevm_step_opcodes / sevm_run_to), inspect with
windowed reads (sevm_read_memory, sevm_disassemble, sevm_read_source), evaluate
Solidity against the paused frame (sevm_evaluate), and mutate live state
(sevm_write_storage, sevm_set_stack_slot, sevm_set_gas).

Every navigation tool returns the same stop report (pc, opcode, gas, stack top,
stack delta since the previous stop), so you always know where you are in one
call. Results that can exceed your context are windowed and carry
`truncated: true` — narrow the offset instead of asking for more.

Unlike a human at a terminal you cannot scroll or watch panes: rely on
sevm_diff_since_last_stop after each step to see what changed (stack pushes /
pops with values, changed memory ranges, gas spent).
